## Exercise

This exercise is part of [BeCode's](https://becode.org/) Junior Web Developer bootcamp curriculum.

The website must contain a functional hangman game. To make it a bit different, I changed the nominal hangman for a colorful piñata.

The game uses a list of common and not-so-common words in English.

**Site functionalities:**

- On load and refresh, a random word is picked from a dictionary of +2500 English words.
- Users can input a letter, either lower or upper case, and press 'enter' to submit.
- Input is limited to one character. Mobile users with predictive text on are able to input more than one character, but only the the first character will count.
- Correctly guessed letters appear in the target word.
- Incorrectly guessed words appear below the input field and add another piece to the piñata's image.
- On victory or loss, the answer reveals itself with a little animation.
- On victory, a happy llama appears doing a little dance.
